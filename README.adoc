= Students Dojo in Java

A workshop for students organized by bol.com

During an afternoon at the bol.com office,
high-school students,
with basic Java programming knowledge,
will do a kata and receive a homework assignment.

The purpose of the kata is to learn some Clean Code principles,
TDD, and refactoring.

The purpose of the homework assignment is to give the students an idea of a real assignment,
in a simplified context/architecture.
Which will be reviewed, and feedback provided, by bol.com engineers.
