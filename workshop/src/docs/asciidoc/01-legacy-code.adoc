= Legacy Code

Code that does its thing,
but is old and/or isn't up to par with the latest code guidelines and principles,
is commonly marked as Legacy Code.
The same goes for code that isn't covered by tests.

When starting refactoring legacy code,
we ask our selves some of the following questions:

- Where to start?
- If I start here will it cause problems later on?
- I see 2-3 options, which one should I choose?

First and foremost,
find the smallest piece of code that you can start refactoring.
For that piece,
create unit tests which tests the boundaries and special cases.
Then, start refactoring!
Take very small steps,
create additional tests when needed,
and keep those tests green.

To help refactoring towards clean code and object oriented concepts,
there are the
link:legacy-code/DevelopersAnonymous-ObjectCalisthenics.pdf[9 Object Calisthenics rules]:

1. One level of indentation per method
2. Don't use the `else` keyword
3. Wrap all primitives and Strings
4. First class collections (wrap all collections)
5. One dot per line
6. Don't abbreviate
7. Keep all entities small
8. No classes with more than two instance variables
9. No getters/setters/properties

These rules are good practise for all code,
not only legacy code.

Next, some tips to help you apply the 9 rules.

== How to calculate the number of code dependencies

.Given code sample
[source,java,linenums]
----
places[currentPlayer] = places[currentPlayer] + diceResult;
if (places[currentPlayer] > 11)
    places[currentPlayer] = places[currentPlayer] - 12;
----

- Line 3 is the deepest nested code.
  It has 2 dependencies, namely: `places` and `currentPlayer`
- If we include line 2,
  we still find 2 dependencies, namely: `places` and `currentPlayer`
- If we include line 1,
  we find 3 dependencies, namely: `places`, `currentPlayer`, and `diceResult`

That's how you calculate the number of dependencies in a piece of code.

== How to reduce the number of code dependencies

=== Extract local variable

.This code depends on `items` and `i`
[source,java]
----
if (items.get(i).getQuality() > 0) {
----

.If we declare `item` above, the if statement has only one dependency: `item`
[source,java]
----
Item item = items.get(i);

if (item.getQuality() > 0) {
----

This is called the "extract local variable" refactoring.

=== Invert `if`-statement

.The code below has 2 dependencies: `quality` and `name`
[source,java]
----
if (quality > 0) {
    if (!name.equals("Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros")) {
        quality = quality - 1;
    }
}
----

.By simply inverting the if statements, weâ€™re able to group the instructions about quality
[source,java]
----
if (!name.equals("Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros")) {
    if (quality > 0) {
        quality = quality - 1;
    }
}
----

This is called the "invert `if`-statement" refactoring.

== Wrap integer with domain concept

[source,java]
----
public class Discounter {
    private int discount;

    public int applyTo(int initialPrice) {
        return initialPrice - discount;
    }

    // ...
}
----

.Becomes
[source,java]
----
public class Discounter {
    private Money discount;

    public Money applyTo(Money initialPrice) {
        return initialPrice.minus(discount);
    }

    // ...
}

public class Money {
    private int discountInCents;

    // ...
}
----

== How to get rid of `else`-statements

=== Early Return

[source,java]
----
public boolean isValidEmail(String email) {
    if (validFormat(email)) {
        // do logic
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
----

.Becomes
[source,java]
----
public boolean isValidEmail(String email) {
    if (!validFormat(email)) {
        return false;
    }
    // do logic
}
----

Returning from a method as soon as possible,
keeps the code readable,
focused on the actual logic,
and minimally indented.

=== Polymorphism

Polymorphism is an alternative to `if`/`else`/`switch`-statements.
For instance,
it is possible to use the
http://www.oodesign.com/strategy-pattern.html[Strategy Pattern]
or inheritance to replace every clause in the control statement.

There are variations to how the "right" strategy is obtained, eg.:

* Caller provides the strategy (as a method argument)
* Strategy is memorised as member variable
* Strategy is obtained from a map (or any other lookup mechanism)

=== Null Object, Optional, or Empty list

A Null Object is an object with no referenced value or with defined neutral (`null`) behavior.

The
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Optional.html[Java Optional]
, https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#emptyList()[Collections#emptyList()]
, https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#emptyMap()[Collections#emptyMap()]
, https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#emptySet()[Collections#emptySet()]
, https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#emptyListIterator()[Collections#emptyListIterator()]
, and https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#emptyEnumeration()[Collections#emptyEnumeration()]
, are all implementations of the Null Object provided by the Java language.

Using Null Object dramatically reduces the need for `null` checking.

.Example without Optional
[source,java]
----
SoundCard soundcard = ...;
if(soundcard != null){
  System.out.println(soundcard);
}
----

.Example with Optional
[source,java]
----
Optional<Soundcard> soundcard = ...;
soundcard.ifPresent(System.out::println);
----
