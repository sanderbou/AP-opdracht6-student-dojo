= Introduction

Welcome to the Code Dojo for Students workshop `(ʘ‿ʘ)╯`

So what is "Dojo" thing?::
+
"Dojo (道場 dōjō) is a Japanese term which literally means "place of the way".
Initially, dōjōs were adjunct to temples."
-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dojo

During a Code Dojo commonly koans and katas are practised.
Say what?

Koans::
"a paradoxical anecdote or riddle without a solution,
used in Zen Buddhism to demonstrate the inadequacy of logical reasoning and provoke enlightenment."
-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dan
+
These are exercises that are complete,
but miss a snippet of code to make it run successful.
It's up to you to provide the snippet and make it succeed.
These exercises are very good to learn specific rules and syntax of a programming language.

Katas::
"an individual training exercise in karate and other martial arts"
-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata
+
These are exercises where there is only a problem description,
the exercise is to implement a solution.
You can (and should) implement and re-implement katas many times.
This will give you the practise of solving different type of problems,
and every time you solve it again you will become quicker and better at it.
These exercises are also perfect to learn new programming languages,
or new features of programming languages.
eg. by implementing a kata in Java 6, Java 7, Java 8, Scala, Ruby, Groovy, etc.
You'll quickly learn the specifics of each of the languages.

This Code Dojo you'll practise a kata in the Java programming language.
During this kata you'll learn and apply some techniques to get to Clean Code.

Clean Code?::

Let me introduce you to Robert C. Martin,
aka Uncle Bob,
the writer of the books
https://www.bol.com/nl/p/clean-code/1001004006133271/[Clean Code]
and https://www.bol.com/nl/p/the-clean-coder/1001004011182718/[The Clean Coder],
and the creator of the
https://cleancoders.com[Clean Coders]
video series.
In his books and videos he shows you principles that help you write clean code.
Some may seem extreme,
some may seem obvious,
but overall you'll benefit from having seen his vision on clean code.
