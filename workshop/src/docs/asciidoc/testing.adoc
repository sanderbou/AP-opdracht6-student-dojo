== Test-Driven Development

Test-Driven Development,
or TDD for short.

A quick introduction from lynda.com:
https://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/What-TDD/124398/137959-4.html[What is TDD?]

=== Three laws of TDD

1. Write *no* production code,
   except to pass a failing test
2. Write only __enough__ of a test
   to demonstrate a failure
3. Write only __enough__ production code
   to pass the test

=== Red-Green-Refactor

Red/Green/Refactor,
http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/12/17/TheCyclesOfTDD.html[the minute-by-minute micro-cycle to TDD].

This cycle is typically executed once for every complete unit test,
or once every dozen or so cycles of the three laws.
The rules of this cycle are simple.

1. Create a unit tests that fails
2. Write production code that makes that test pass
3. Clean up the mess you just made

The philosophy is based on the idea that our limited minds are not
capable of pursuing the two simultaneous goals of all software systems:

1. Correct behavior
2. Correct structure

So the Red/Green/Refactor cycle tells us to first focus on making the
software work correctly;
and then, and only then,
to focus on giving that working software a long-term survivable structure.

Executing the Red/Green/Refactor cycle takes on the order of a minute or so.
This is the granularity of refactoring.
Refactoring is not something you do at the end of the project;
itâ€™s something you do on a __minute-by-minute__ basis.
There is no task on the project plan that says: Refactor.
There is no time reserved at the end of the project,
or the iteration, or the day, for refactoring.
Refactoring is a continuous in-process activity,
not something that is done late (and therefore optionally).
